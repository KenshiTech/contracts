# User Documentation for ERC20 Token

## Introduction

Welcome to the user guide for our ERC20 Token! ERC20 is a widely adopted token standard in the Ethereum ecosystem. This user guide will walk you through how to interact with our ERC20 token.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, you will need an Ethereum wallet. Some popular options include MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, or Trust Wallet. Ensure that your wallet is configured to interact with the Ethereum network where the token is deployed.

## Viewing Your Token Balance

To view your token balance, follow these steps:

1. Open your Ethereum wallet.
2. Navigate to the "Add Token" or similar function in your wallet.
3. Input the contract address of our ERC20 token. This is a unique address that identifies our token on the blockchain.
4. Once you've added the token, you should be able to see your balance.

## Transferring Tokens

To send tokens to another address:

1. Navigate to the "Send" or similar function in your wallet.
2. Select our ERC20 token from the list of tokens you can send.
3. Input the recipient's address and the amount of tokens you wish to send.
4. Confirm the transaction. Please note that you will need to pay a gas fee in ETH to make this transaction.

## Approving a Spend

ERC20 tokens have a feature where you can approve another address to spend tokens on your behalf. This is useful for interacting with smart contracts.

1. Navigate to the "Approve" or similar function in your wallet. Note: this might not be a standard feature in all wallets. You may need to interact directly with the contract or use a DApp.
2. Select our ERC20 token from the list.
3. Input the spender's address and the amount you wish to approve.
4. Confirm the transaction. Again, you will need to pay a gas fee for this transaction.

## Checking Allowance

You can check the amount of tokens you've allowed a particular address to spend.

1. Navigate to the "Check Allowance" or similar function in your wallet. As with approving a spend, this might require direct contract interaction or a DApp.
2. Select our ERC20 token from the list.
3. Input your address and the spender's address.
4. The returned number is the amount of tokens the spender is allowed to use on your behalf.

## Increasing or Decreasing Allowance

You can adjust the allowance you've set for a particular address.

1. Navigate to "Increase Allowance" or "Decrease Allowance" or similar functions in your wallet. These might not be standard features.
2. Select our ERC20 token from the list.
3. Input the spender's address and the amount by which you wish to increase or decrease the allowance.
4. Confirm the transaction, which will require a gas fee.

## Recovering ERC20 Tokens

If you accidentally send ERC20 tokens to the contract address, the contract owner can recover and return them to you. Contact the contract owner for assistance.

Please remember to handle your tokens and wallet credentials responsibly. Don't share sensitive information, like private keys, with anyone. Stay safe!
